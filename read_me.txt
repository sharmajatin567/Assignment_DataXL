My name is Jatin Kumar Sharma and I have successfully completed the assignment by solving the problem stated in the assignment. 
The project files are available in the "pythonmail" directory. 
While running the rasa bot, you can type the following commands:-

    "Email xyz@gmail.com, please."
    "Compose an email to xyz@gmail.com."
    "Send an email to xyz@gmail.com."
    "I need to contact xyz@gmail.com."
    "Help me email xyz@gmail.com."
    "Draft email for xyz@gmail.com."
    "Message xyz@gmail.com."
    "Reach out to xyz@gmail.com."
    "Contact xyz@gmail.com by email."
    "Email xyz@gmail.com now."

The bot will send a message to "xyz@gmail.com" from my dummy email id "jatin.heyall@gmail.com" with subject "Test" and message "Hi". 
These values have been hardcoded in the actions.py script but can be customized by using forms and slots.
The labelled screenshots regarding the codes and outputs have been places in the "screenshots" folder. 
In the output, I have used my official email id "sharmajatin567@gmail.com" as the receiver mail.
